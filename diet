FATS
1. Monounsaturated fats are found in high concentrations in:
        ◦ Olive, peanut, and canola oils 
        ◦ Avocados 
        ◦ Nuts such as almonds, hazelnuts, and pecans 
        ◦ Seeds such as pumpkin and sesame seeds 
2. Polyunsaturated fats are found in high concentrations in
        ◦ Sunflower, corn, soybean, and flaxseed oils 
        ◦ Walnuts 
        ◦ Flax seeds 
        ◦ Fish 
        ◦ Canola oil – though higher in monounsaturated fat, it’s also a good source of polyunsaturated fat. 
Omega-3 fats are an important  type of polyunsaturated fat. The body can’t make these, so they must come from food.
    • An excellent way to get omega-3 fats is by eating fish 2-3 times a week. 
    • Good plant sources of omega-3 fats include flax seeds, walnuts, and canola or soybean oil. 
“Good” unsaturated fats — Monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats — lower disease risk. Foods high in good fats include vegetable oils (such as olive, canola, sunflower, soy, and corn), nuts, seeds, and fish.
