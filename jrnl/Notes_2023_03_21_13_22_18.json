Take notice on how the sqedual is perfetcly optimized for self improvment. There is no time to waste. Obiously we need to work. We need a stream of income. My thought prosses before was 'how do i make passive income'.
It does'nt exist. You will alwasy work for money. Now. My self improvment story begins with this sqedual. A remote job is the key. Right now. Commuting to and from work is horrible. It is leaving me in a state where
I make constant excuses for not using this sqedual. Eating out. Weed use. Alcohol Use. Porn. Gaming. All these things are keeping me stuck. Working remote cuts out the need for travel. I can truly follow this sqedual
tot he fullest extent. Finally cutting porna nd gaming out of my life. I have already cut Weed and Alcohol. I have cut out all the Slave minded people i associated with. I focus on my Mother. Father. Older Brother. 
Younger Brother. These people are truly the only ones who matter to me. Everyone else are two faced slaves. Now. I am on a path to redemption. Ultimetly conculding with true Freedom. I despertly cling to the hope
that I can save my Family. They deserve to be free, however I fear that the programming has rooted deep inside them. I will try. I have too. But first. I need to prove to myself I can. It starts with this sqedual.
I am blessed that my Parents let me live in there house for free. Yes they provide me with everything I need. Hyguine. Cleaning. Food. Everything. My parents are the best. I love them to the highest degree.
The most I love about them is their patiance. Even at my lowest they never abandoned me. They are part of the reason I didnt end my life. So, back to the sqedual. Its time. Im done playing this if this if then if
when if who if where game. Its time for action. I will succseed. Once I achive this perfect form. Then. And only then will the path to freedom become clear. I have a vision of my future. It cannot become reality 
if I dont impove myself here and now.
