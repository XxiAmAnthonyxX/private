It is currently Friday May 10th 12:36 am. I'm nearly done with my new and improved dot files. I've made some pretty drastic changes. Most of which I believe are necessary. So. I know I have configs already. but something about just installing packages and configuring from scratch just intrigues me so much. But yeah as for the packages i'm more satisfied with my list. It's mainly minimal. I feel like I can condense it further. Starting with my major flaw. Spotify. It is the only account I have on my entire system. Everything else requires no account. I guess that's a good segway into the other topic on my mind currently. My "Anthony Hernandez" Profile. At least the digital version. 

Steam, GTA 5, Overwatch 2, Minecraft, Apex Legends, Geometry Dash, Wizard 101
Spotify, Snapchat, Reddit, YouTube, Discord
Google "Maps/Chrome/Docs/Drive/Gmail/Play"
Chase, Xfinity

Well. That's the last of it. Fuck me. I need to get away. Fast. Everything is being tracked. Being used against us. Fine. I'll go through google tomorrow. Wipe it.
